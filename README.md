#This is the cube that never ends


Originally, this was going to be a project just dealing with file reading and log decryption. I then learned that I have more paitence with graphics programming than I do trying to crack log files. (I really wish I could though)
So forgive any references to "FileReader3" I would love to rename files in Visual Studio without shooting myself in the foot. 

If you do decide to try this out, (thanks!) green is the front facing Matrix of the cube, W on keyboard will make the cube move forward, A and D strafe to the sides, and S moves backwards. Space bar currently rotates the cube, 
and the up and down keys make the cube move... Up and down !
